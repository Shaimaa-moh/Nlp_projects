# Natural Language Processing 
NLP is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. 
It involves various tasks such as text analysis, language translation, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval.
# Nlp Preprocessing
- Translate the english words and franko to arabic

- Apply ar-corrector to check the mispelling of the word 
- Tokenize the tweets
- Remove the stop words
- Check all characters are arabic

# TF-IDF Transformation
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).
The TF-IDF value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in a document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus, helping to filter out common terms.
# Similarity Detection
Using TF-IDF vectors, we can measure the similarity between documents by computing the cosine similarity between their vectors.
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two documents are, irrespective of their size.
By converting text descriptions to TF-IDF vectors and computing similarities, we can match text queries to relevant information.
